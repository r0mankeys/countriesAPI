## Description

This is a straight forward project that uses the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to display information about countries.

Heavly inspired by the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

Part of a larger project "APIgarden" where I will be using different APIs to create small projects.

## Features

- [x] Search for a country
- [x] Filter countries by region
